## Summary Statistics

- **Total components tracked**: 65
- **✅ FORMALIZED**: 19 (29%)
- **📝 DOCUMENTED**: 28 (43%)
- **💭 CONCEPTUALIZED**: 12 (18%)
- **❌ NOT STARTED**: 6 (9%)

The project is 72% documented or better. The critical gap is the 18% that's conceptualized but not written down, and the 9% not started. The formalized components are heavily concentrated in Python code (signal, duality graph, COEF) and SING/DANCE documents. The theory layer and protocol specs are where formalization is most needed.
